weather station ðŸš‰ 
currently working on a breadboard weatherstation, no idea what I am doing, zero engineering background aside from being related to a few engineers both civil and computer science as well as electrical, but again, I have no idea what I'm doing this is a educational endevor, I am a complete newb, oh not that I haven't built, ikea furniture, two computers, and a 3d printer and some little raspberry-pi builds, still a newb imho. Dream is to build my own motorcycle but thats another project entirely.
